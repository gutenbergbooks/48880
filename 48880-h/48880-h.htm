<p class='c003'>■ The field of the experimental Telethink
station in the Florida Keys
caught the fleeing Morid’s attention
just as its stolen Federation lifeboat
plunged into the outer reaches of
nightside atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Morid reacted with the instant
decision of a harried wolf
stumbling upon a dark cave that offers
not only sanctuary but a lost
lamb for supper as well. With the
pursuing Federation ship hot on its
taloned heels, the Morid zeroed on
the Telethink signals—fuzzy and incomprehensibly
alien to its viciously
direct mentality, but indicating life
and therefore food—and aimed
straight for their source.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lifeboat crashed headlong in
the mangroves fringing Dutchman’s
Key, perhaps ten miles west of the
Oversea Highway and less than two
from the Telethink station. The
Morid emerged in snarling haste,
anticipating the powerplant’s explosion
by a matter of seconds, and
vanished like a magenta-furred juggernaut
into the moonlit riot of vegetation
that crowded back from the
mangroved strip of beach. The Morid
considered it a success.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lifeboat went up in a cataclysmic
roar and flare of bluish light
that brought Vann, the Telethink
operator on duty, out of his goldberg
helmet with a prickly conviction of
runaway range missiles. It all but
blinded and deafened Ellis, his partner,
who was cruising with a portable
Telethink in the station launch
through a low-lying maze of islands
a quarter of a mile from Dutchman’s
Key.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their joint consternation was lost
on the Morid because both at the
moment were outside its avid reach.
The teeming welter of life on
Dutchman’s Key was not. The Morid
headed inland, sensing abundant
quarry to satisfy the ravening hunger
that drove it and, that craving
satisfied, to offer ample scope to its
joy of killing.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>The Morid’s escape left Xaxtol,
Federation ship’s commander, in a
dilemma bordering upon the insoluble.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would have been bad enough to
lose so rare a specimen even on a
barren world, but to have one so
voracious at large upon one so
teeming—as the primitive Telethink
signals demonstrated—with previously
unsuspected intelligence was
unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c004'>This, at the outset, was Xaxtol’s
problem:</p>

<p class='c004'>Forbidden by strictest Galactic injunction,
he could not make planetfall
and interfere with a previously
unscouted primitive culture. Contrariwise,
neither could civilized
ethic condone his abandoning such
an unsuspecting culture to the
bloody mercies of a Morid without
every effort to correct his blunder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hanging in stationary orbit in order
to keep a fixed relation to the
Morid’s landing site, the Federation
commander debated earnestly with
his staff until a sudden quickening of
the barbarous Telethink net made
action imperative.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two of the autochthons were isolated
on a small island with the
Morid. Unwarned, they were
doomed.</p>

<p class='c004'>So he grouped his staff about him—sitting,
crouching, coiling or hovering,
as individual necessity demanded—and
as one entity put the
whole into rapport with the all-but-meaningless
signals that funneled up
from the Telethink station in the
Florida Keys.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, in doing so, roused a consternation
as great as his own and
infinitely more immediate.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>The flash brought Vann away
from the Telethink console and out
of the quonset station to stare
shakenly across the tangle of
mangroved islands to the west. Weyman
came out a moment later, on the
run, when the teeth-jarring blast of
the explosion woke him. They stood
together on the moon-bright sand
and Vann relayed in four words the
total of his information.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It fell over there,” Vann said.</p>

<p class='c004'>A pale pinkish cloud of smoke
and steam rose and drifted phosphorescently
toward a noncommittal
moon.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Second key out,” Weyman said.
“That would be Dutchman’s, where
the hermit lives.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann nodded, drawing minimal
reassurance from the fact that there
had been no mushroom. “It shouldn’t
be atomic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Gulf breeze was steady out of
the west, freighted with its perpetual
salt-and-mangrove smell.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Geigers will tell us soon
enough,” Weyman said. “Not that
it’ll help us, with Ellis out in the
launch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They looked at each other in sudden
shock of joint realization.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The launch,” Vann said. “Ellis is
out there with the portable Telethink
rig. We were working out
field-strength ratios for personal
equipment—”</p>

<p class='c004'>They dived for the quonset together.
Vann, smaller and more agile
than the deliberate Weyman,
reached the Telethink first.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing but the regular standby
carrier from Washington,” Vann
said. “Ellis may have been directly
under the thing when it struck. He
was working toward Dutchman’s
Key, hoping for a glimpse of the
hermit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe he wasn’t wearing the
Telethink when the blast came,”
Weyman said. Then, with characteristic
practicality: “Better image
Washington about this while we’re
waiting for Ellis to report in. Can’t
use the net radio—we’d start a
panic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann settled himself at the console.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll try. That is, if I can get across
anything beyond the sort of subliminal
rot we’ve been trading
lately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He signaled for contact and felt
the Washington operator’s answering
surge of subconscious resentment at
being disturbed. With the closing of
the net the now-familiar giddiness of
partial rapport came on him, together
with the oppressive sense of
bodily sharing.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a sudden trickle of
saliva in his mouth and he resisted
the desire to spit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Washington is having a midnight
snack,” Vann said. “Rotted sardines
and Limburger, I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made correction when the
Washington operator radiated indignation.
“Goose liver and dill
pickles, then, but you wouldn’t guess
it. Salt tastes like brass filings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Weyman said shortly, “Get on with
it. You can clown later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann visualized the flare of explosion
and winced at the panicky
hammer-and-sickled surmise that
came back to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How would I know?” he said
aloud. “We have a man out—”</p>

<p class='c004'>He recalled the inherent limitation
of phonetics then and fell back
upon imagery, picturing Ellis’ launch
heading toward an island luridly
lighted by the blast. For effect he
added, on the key’s minuscule beach,
a totally imaginary shack of driftwood,
complete with bearded
hermit.</p>

<p class='c004'>He knew immediately when authority
arrived at the other end of
the net. There was a mental backwash
of conversation that told him
his orders even before the Washington
operator set himself for their
relay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They want an eyewitness account
from Ellis,” he told Weyman.
“As if—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ellis broke into the net at that
moment, radiating a hazy image—he
was still partially blinded from
the glare of the blast—of a lowering
key overhung by a dwindling pall of
pinkish smoke. In the foreground of
lagoon and mangroves stood a stilted
shack not unlike the one Vann had
pictured, but without the hermit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instead, the rickety elevation of
thatched porch was a blot of sable
darkness relieved only by a pair of
slanted yellow eyes gleaming close to
the floor.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>Climactically, Xaxtol entered the
net then with an impact of total information
that was more than the
human psyche, conditioned to serialized
thinking by years of phonetic
communication, could bear.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Washington operator
screamed and tore off his helmet, requiring
restraint until he could compose
himself enough to relay his
message.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ellis, in his launch, fainted dead
away and ran the boat headlong
aground on the beach of Dutchman’s
Key.</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann reeled in his chair, teetering
between shock and lunacy, until
Weyman caught him and slid the
Telethink from his head. It was minutes
before Vann could speak; when
he did, it was with a macabre flippancy
that Weyman found more
convincing than any dramatics.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s come,” Vann said. “There’s
an interstellar ship out there with a
thousand-odd crew that would give
Dali himself nightmares.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Weyman had to shake him forcibly
before he could continue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re sorry they can’t put
down and help us,” Vann said.
“Galactic regulations, it seems. But
they feel they should warn us that
they’ve let some sort of bloodthirsty
jungle monster—a specimen they
were freighting to an interplanetary
zoo—escape in a lifeboat. It’s loose
down here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dutchman’s Key,” Weyman
breathed. “What kind of brute could
live through a blast like <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It left the lifeboat before the
power plant blew,” Vann said.
“They’re tracking its aura now. It’s
intelligent to a degree—about on
par with ourselves, I gather—and
it’s big. It’s the largest and most
vicious life form they’ve met in kilo-years
of startrading.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He frowned over a concept unsuited
to words. “Longer than thousands.
Their culture goes back so far
that the term doesn’t register.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ellis,” Weyman said. “Tell him
to sheer off. Tell him to keep away
from that island.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann clapped on the Telethink
helmet and felt real panic when he
found the net vacant except for a
near-hysterical Washington operator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aliens are off the air,” he said.
“But I can’t feel Ellis.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe he isn’t wearing his Telethink.
I’ll try his launch radio.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had the microphone in his
hand when Vann said, “They got the
message in Washington, and they’re
petrified. I asked for a copter to
pick up Ellis—and the hermit, if
they can reach them before this
<i>thing</i> does—but they’re thinking
along different lines. They’re sending
a squadron of jet bombers with
nonatomic HE to make sure the
beast doesn’t escape to the mainland
and devastate the countryside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Weyman said incredulously,
“They’ll blow the key to bits. What
about Ellis and the hermit?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ellis is to evacuate him if possible.
They’re giving us twenty minutes
before the jets come. After
that—”</p>

<p class='c004'>He didn’t have to finish.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>At midnight old Charlie Trask
was wading knee-deep in the eastside
grass flats of his private lagoon,
methodically netting shrimp that
darted to the ooze-clouded area
stirred up by his ragged wading
shoes. An empty gunny sack hung
across one shoulder, ready for the
coon oysters he would pick from
mangrove roots on his way back to
his shack.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his dour and antisocial way,
Charlie was content. He had nearly
enough shrimp for boiling and for
bait, with the prospect of coon oyster
stew in the offing. He had
tobacco for his pipe and cartridges
for his single-shot .22 rifle and a
batch of potent homebrew ready for
the bottling.</p>

<p class='c004'>What more could a man want?</p>

<p class='c004'>The blast and glare of the
Morid’s landing on the western
fringe of his key jarred Charlie from
his mellow mood like a clear-sky
thunderbolt. The concussion rattled
what teeth remained to him and
brought a distant squall from his
cat, a scarred and cynical old tom
named Max, at the shack.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Damn rockets</i>, was Charlie’s instant
thought. <i>Fool around till they
blow us all to hell.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The rosy phosphorescence drifting
up from the mangroves a quarter
of a mile away colored his resentment
with alarm. A blast like
that could start a fire, burn across
the key and gut his shack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grumbling at the interruption of
his midnight foray, Charlie crimped
the lid tight on his shrimp bucket
and stalked back along the lagoon
toward his shack. The coon oysters
would have to wait.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five minutes later he reached his
personal castle, perched on precarious
piling in a gap hewn from the
mangroves. The moon made it, to
Charlie, a thing of black-and-silver
beauty, with Max’s yellow eyes
gleaming from the porch floor like
wicked, welcoming beacons.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still muttering, Charlie waded out
of the shallow-water ooze and
stumped in squishing shoes up the
ladder to his shack. The shrimp
bucket he hung on a wall peg out of
Max’s calculating reach. He found
his pipe in the kitchen and loaded
and lighted it, deliberately because
the capacity for haste was not in
him. His homebrew crock bubbled
seductively and he took time out to
raise the grimy toweling that covered
it and sniff appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ready to cap by the time I come
back and get the shrimp graded,” he
told Max.</p>

<p class='c004'>He changed his dripping brogans
for a pair of snake-proof boots and
took down his .22 rifle from its pegs,
not because he really imagined that
anyone might have lived through
such a blast but because strangers—them
radio fellows two keys east, for
instance—might take it into their
heads to come prying around.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was halfway across the key
when the drone of Ellis’ launch entering
his lagoon justified his suspicions.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>Charlie’s investigation was soon
over.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dying plume of steam rising
from a circle of battered mangroves
told him that no danger of fire impended,
and he turned back in relief.
It did not occur to him that the pilot
of his hypothetical rocket might be
lying desperately injured in the shallow
water, at the mercy of sharks
and crocodiles. If it had, he would
not have moved to help. Any fool
who got himself into such a spot, in
Charlie’s rude philosophy, could get
himself out.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drone of the launch’s engine
was loud when he reached his shack.
The boat, handled by a pilot grotesque
in what Charlie took at first
for a diver’s helmet, was heading
directly for his landing at an unsafe
speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Serve him right if he shoals on a
oyster bed and rips his bottom,”
Charlie said.</p>

<p class='c004'>As if on cue, the boat swerved
sharply. Its pilot came half erect,
arms flung wide in a convulsive gesture.
The engine roared wildly; the
boat heeled, slamming its occupant
against the right gunwale, and
blasted straight for Charlie’s shack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miraculously, it missed the
shack’s piling and lunged half its
length upon the sand. The engine-roar
died instantly. The pilot was
thrown headlong overside, goldberg
helmet flying off in mid-arc, to lie
stunned at the foot of Charlie’s
ladder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Callously, Charlie stepped over
Ellis’ twitching form and stumped
up the ladder to his shack. Max, who
had taken to the porch rafters at the
crash of the launch, came meowing
gingerly down to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s all right,” Charlie told him.
“Just some fool that don’t know
how to handle a boat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He leaned his rifle against the
wall and brought a split-bamboo
chair from the kitchen. He was not
too late; the bucket, when he took it
from its peg, still slithered satisfactorily
with live shrimp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The squawking of the launch radio
roused Ellis. He groaned and sat
up, dazed and disoriented by the
combined shock of Xaxtol’s telepathic
bombshell and his own rude
landing, just as Weyman gave up
his attempt at radio contact. In the
silence that fell, Ellis would have
fainted again except for the chilling
knowledge that he was unarmed and
afoot on the same key with a man-eating
alien monster that might
make its appearance at any moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>He collected wits and breath to
stave off the black pall of shock that
still threatened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come down from there and help
me push the launch off,” he called up
to Charlie Trask. “We’ve got to get
off this key. Fast!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie separated a menu-sized
shrimp from his bucket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You grounded her,” he said
sourly. “Push her off yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen,” Ellis said desperately.
“That blast was a ship from space,
from another star. A wild animal escaped
from it, something worse than
you ever dreamed of. We’ve got to
get out of here before it finds us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie grunted and chose another
shrimp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Morid, as Xaxtol had pictured
it, rose vividly in Ellis’ memory,
fanged and shaggy and insatiably
voracious, a magenta-furred
ursine embodiment of blood-lust
made the worst by its near-human
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c004'>He described it in dogged haste,
his eyes frozen to the tangle of inland
underbrush behind the shack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No such varmint in these kays,”
old Charlie said.</p>

<p class='c004'>The launch radio blared again in
Weyman’s voice, speaking urgently
of jet bombers and deadlines. A
glance at his watch brought Ellis up
from the sand in galvanic resolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In twelve minutes,” he said
grimly, “a squadron of planes will
pinpoint this key and blast it out of
the water. I’m not going to be eaten
alive or blown to bits arguing with
you. If I can’t push the launch off
alone, I’ll swim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He scooped up his fallen Telethink
helmet and ran for the launch.
At the fourth step his foot caught in
the iron-hard stump of a mangrove
root that had been chopped off
inches above the sand and he fell
heavily. Pain blinded him; his right
ankle lanced with fire and went
numb.</p>

<p class='c004'>He fought to rise and fell again
when the ankle collapsed under him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>Hell</i>,” he said, just before blackness
claimed him for the second time.
“I’ve broken my leg!”</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>His twelve minutes had dwindled
to seven when Ellis roused. He tried
to stand, his twisted ankle momentarily
forgotten, and gave it up when
the mangroves spun dizzily before
his eyes. He couldn’t afford to pass
out again.</p>

<p class='c004'>He made one last-ditch bid for
help.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My leg’s broken,” he yelled up at
old Charlie Trask. “Get down here
and lend a hand!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie glowered and said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Max bounded down the ladder,
tail stiffly erect and scarred ears
cocked at the underbrush in baleful
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing is coming this way,”
Ellis called. “Your cat scents it. Will
you let us all be killed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie Trask graded another
shrimp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Swearing bitterly, Ellis caught up
his Telethink helmet and slid it over
his head. He found the net in a
welter of confusion. Washington demanded
further information; Vann,
at the station, was calling him
frantically. His own scramble for
help-images only added to the mental
babel.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the Federation ship, confusion
was nearly as rampant.</p>

<p class='c004'>Xaxtol’s dilemma still held: he
could not make planetfall—time was
too short for aid now, in any case—but
neither could he, with clear
Galactic conscience, desert the harried
primitives below while hope
remained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ellis’ predicament forced Xaxtol
to decision; he could only follow the
Morid’s aura and relay its progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>It could not be helped that the relayed
image was blurred of definition
and weirdly askew; the Morid’s
visual and auditory range differed so
sharply from either human or Galactic
that even over the ship’s wonderfully
selective telecommunicator little
of the Morid’s immediate surroundings
came through clearly. Its
aura arrived with a burning intensity
that turned Xaxtol and his group
faint with empathetic horror, but
the fact that the Morid had just
made its first kill obliterated all detail
for the moment beyond a shocking
welter of blood and torn flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ellis fared a little better under the
second telepathic blast than under
the first—he managed to snatch off
his Telethink helmet just in time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing just killed something
out there,” he yelled at Charlie
Trask. “It’s coming this way. Are
you going to sit there and—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie graded his last edible
shrimp, took up his bucket and went
inside. The leisurely clinking of
homebrew bottles drifted after him,
clear and musical on the still, hot
air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ellis looked at his watch and considered
prayer. He had three minutes
left.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>When the Morid came, Ellis was
sitting dumbly on the sand, nursing
his broken ankle and considering
with a shock-detached part of his
mind a fragmentary line of some
long-forgotten schooldays poem.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>What rough beast is this</i> ... the
rest eluded him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The underbrush beyond the
shack rustled and the Morid’s ravening
image sprang to Ellis’ mind with
a clarity that shook his three net-participants
to the core—one of
them past endurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann, in the station, said “<i>Dear
God</i>,” and braced himself for the
end. In Washington, the operator
fainted and had to be dragged from
his console.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aboard the Federation ship,
Xaxtol radiated a shaken “Enough!”
and tentacled a stud that sent his
craft flashing on its way through
subspace.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Charlie Trask’s shack, Max
bounded across the clearing and into
the brush. There followed a riot of
squalling and screaming that
brought Charlie out of his shack on
the run. Ellis sat numbly, beyond
shock, waiting for the worst.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unaccountably, the worst was
delayed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Charlie came back, clutching a
protesting Max by the scruff of the
neck, and threw down something at
Ellis’ feet. Something small and limp
and magenta-furred, smeared with
greenish blood and very, very dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s your varmint,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p class='c004'>With one minute remaining before
the promised bombers roared over,
Ellis, with a frozen clarity he had
not dreamed he possessed, radiated
a final message before he fainted
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call off the jets,” he said, in effect.
“It’s over. The beast is dead.
The hermit’s cat killed it.”</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>An hour later at the station, his
ankle bandaged and his third cup of
coffee in hand, Ellis could review it
all with some coherence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We didn’t consider the business
of relative size,” he said. “Neither
did our Galactic friends. Apparently
they’re small, and so are all the
species they’ve met with before.
Maybe we’re something unique in
the universe, after all. And maybe
it’s a good thing they didn’t land
and learn how unique.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It figures,” Weyman said. “Washington
let it out on the air that DF
stations made a fix on the spaceship
before it jumped off. It measured
only twenty-two feet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann said wonderingly, “And
there were hundreds of them aboard.
Gentlemen, we are Brobdingnagians
in a universe of Lilliputians.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been trying,” Ellis said irrelevantly,
“to recall a poem I read
once in school. I’ve forgotten the
author and all the verse but one line.
It goes—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>What rough beast is this</i>,” Vann
quoted. “You were thinking about it
hard enough when the debacle in
the brush took place. The image you
radiated was rough enough—it
shocked the pants off us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And off the Galactics,” Weyman
said. “The shoe is on the other foot
now, I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went to the quonset door and
looked out and up, listening. “Jets.
The Washington brass on its way to
cross-examine us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The other foot?” Vann said.
“Don’t be cryptic, man. Whose
foot?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Theirs,” Ellis said. “Don’t you
see? One of these days we’ll be going
out there to make our own place in
the galaxy. With our size and disposition,
how do you think we’ll seem
to those gentle little people?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Vann whistled in belated understanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rough,” he said.</p>
